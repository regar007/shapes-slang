### Setup:
* download shapes_slang.html and shapes_slang.js in same folder.

* open **shapes_slang.html** in browser to play.

### Instructions to play with the framework :

* Example 1 : "add rect a 10 20 50 70"
	* This adds a rectangle named 'a' at location x = 10, y = 20, width = 20 and height = 70 on screen.
	* User can create as many rectangle as he wants with different names.

* Example 2 : "modify a 20 50 100 200"
	* This modifies the rectangle 'a' with new inputs.

* Example 3 : "pin a 300 400"
	* This places the rectangle 'a' at location x = 300 and y = 400. 

* Example 4 : "rotate a 45" OR "rotate a 2 100"
	* This rotates 'a' with angle of 45.
	* OR rotates 'a' with angle of 2 at speed of 100.

* Example 5 : "move a 10 20"
	* This moves 'a' with speed x = 10 and y = 20.

* Example 6 : "stop a"
	* This stops all rotation and motion of 'a'.

* Example 7 : "remove a"
	* This removes 'a' from screen.
	
* Example 8 : "add circle b 100 200 20"
	* This adds a circle named 'b' at location x = 100, y = 200 and radius = 20 on screen.
	* User can create as many circle as he wants with different names.

* Exmaple 9 : "bind a b 10 20"
	* This binds a as a child to b as parent at location relative to b at x = 10 and y = 20.
